  #Suleiman Ibn Qutalmish becomes ruler of lands seized in the war
  seljuk_invasion_events.0001.title:0 "Thin Blood"
  seljuk_invasion_events.0001.desc:0 "With the Romans defeated, Antalya rests firmly in turkish hands. As the celebrations for our glorious victory are about to begin, a messenger enters the chambers and informs us of the takeover of our newly conquered territories in the west by my distant cousin, Suleyman Ibn Qutalmish, while a local turkic hero known as Danishmend Gazi has been propped up by the tribes in eastern Antalya.\n\nThe son of the pretender especially has always been a thorn in my side, and there is certainly no love lost between us, but seeing as how they both command the loyalty of the local Turkic tribes, maybe giving them control of the region under my supreme authority as a sign of goodwill is the best course of action. Let's hope they don't get any ideas."
